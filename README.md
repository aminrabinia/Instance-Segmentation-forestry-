# Instance-Segmentation-forestry

This project is based on PixelLibe for instance segmentation of woody debris in forest images. The model is trained on labeled images and tested on unseen images to find any instance of dead logs on the forest ground. The input images for this project are a blend of four different layers from the same location during different time periods. Below is an example of the blended image (left) and the automatically annotated logs (right).
